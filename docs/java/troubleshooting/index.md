To troubleshoot the container initialization, such as when server files are pre-downloaded, set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `true`. The container logs will include **much more** output, and it is highly recommended including that output when reporting any [issues](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/issues).

To troubleshoot just the command-line used to start the Minecraft server, set the environment variable `DEBUG_EXEC` to `true`.

To troubleshoot any issues with memory allocation reported by the JVM, set the environment variable `DEBUG_MEMORY` to `true`.

## Server types

### Running a Forge Server

Enable [Forge server](http://www.minecraftforge.net/) mode by adding a `-e TYPE=FORGE` to your command-line.

The overall version is specified by `VERSION`, [as described in the section above](#versions) and will run the recommended Forge version by default. You can also choose to run a specific Forge version with `FORGE_VERSION`, such as `-e FORGE_VERSION=14.23.5.2854`.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=FORGE \
        -e VERSION=1.12.2 -e FORGE_VERSION=14.23.5.2854 \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

To use a pre-downloaded Forge installer, place it in the attached `/data` directory and
specify the name of the installer file with `FORGE_INSTALLER`, such as:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e FORGE_INSTALLER=forge-1.11.2-13.20.0.2228-installer.jar ...

To download a Forge installer from a custom location, such as your own file repository, specify
the URL with `FORGE_INSTALLER_URL`, such as:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e FORGE_INSTALLER_URL=http://HOST/forge-1.11.2-13.20.0.2228-installer.jar ...

In both of the cases above, there is no need for the `VERSION` or `FORGEVERSION` variables.

> If an error occurred while installing Forge, it might be possible to resolve by temporarily setting `FORGE_FORCE_REINSTALL` to "true". Be sure to remove that variable after successfully starting the server.

### Running a Fabric Server

Enable [Fabric server](https://fabricmc.net/) mode by adding a `-e TYPE=FABRIC` to your command-line.

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
    -e TYPE=FABRIC \
    -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server
```

By default, the container will install the latest [fabric server launcher](https://fabricmc.net/use/server/), using the latest [fabric-loader](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/documentation:fabric_loader) against the minecraft version you have defined with `VERSION` (defaulting to the latest vanilla release of the game).

A specific loader or launcher version other than the latest can be requested using `FABRIC_LOADER_VERSION` and `FABRIC_LAUNCHER_VERSION` respectively, such as:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
    -e TYPE=FABRIC \
    -e FABRIC_LAUNCHER_VERSION=0.10.2 \
    -e FABRIC_LOADER_VERSION=0.13.1
```

> If you wish to use an alternative launcher you can:
> * Provide the path to a custom launcher jar available to the container with `FABRIC_LAUNCHER`, relative to `/data` (such as `-e FABRIC_LAUNCHER=fabric-server-custom.jar`)
> * Provide the URL to a custom launcher jar with `FABRIC_LAUNCHER_URL` (such as `-e FABRIC_LAUNCHER_URL=http://HOST/fabric-server-custom.jar`)

See the [Working with mods and plugins](#working-with-mods-and-plugins) section to set up Fabric mods and configuration.

### Running a Quilt Server

Enable [Quilt server](https://quiltmc.org/) mode by adding a `-e TYPE=QUILT` to your command-line.

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
    -e TYPE=QUILT \
    -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server
```

By default, the container will install the latest [quilt server launcher](https://quiltmc.org/install/server/), using the latest [quilt-installer](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-installer) against the minecraft version you have defined with `VERSION` (defaulting to the latest vanilla release of the game).

A specific loader or installer version other than the latest can be requested using `QUILT_LOADER_VERSION` and `QUILT_INSTALLER_VERSION` respectively, such as:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
    -e TYPE=QUILT \
    -e QUILT_LOADER_VERSION=0.16.0 \
    -e QUILT_INSTALLER_VERSION=0.4.1
```

> If you wish to use an alternative launcher you can: 
> * Provide the path to a custom launcher jar available to the container with `QUILT_LAUNCHER`, relative to `/data` (such as `-e QUILT_LAUNCHER=quilt-server-custom.jar`)
> * Provide the URL to a custom launcher jar with `QUILT_LAUNCHER_URL` (such as `-e QUILT_LAUNCHER_URL=http://HOST/quilt-server-custom.jar`)

See the [Working with mods and plugins](#working-with-mods-and-plugins) section to set up Quilt mods and configuration.

### Running a Bukkit/Spigot server

Enable Bukkit/Spigot server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=BUKKIT` or `-e TYPE=SPIGOT` to your command-line.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=SPIGOT \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If the downloaded server jar is corrupted, set `FORCE_REDOWNLOAD` to "true" to force a re-download during next container startup. After successfully re-downloading, you should remove that or set to "false".

If you are hosting your own copy of Bukkit/Spigot you can override the download URLs with:

- -e BUKKIT_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>
- -e SPIGOT_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>

You can build spigot from source by adding `-e BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=true`

Plugins can either be managed within the `plugins` subdirectory of the [data directory](#data-directory) or you can also [attach a `/plugins` volume](#optional-plugins-mods-and-config-attach-points). If you add plugins while the container is running, you'll need to restart it to pick those up.

[You can also auto-download plugins using `SPIGET_RESOURCES`.](#auto-downloading-spigotmcbukkitpapermc-plugins-with-spiget)

> NOTE some of the `VERSION` values are not as intuitive as you would think, so make sure to click into the version entry to find the **exact** version needed for the download. For example, "1.8" is not sufficient since their download naming expects `1.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT-latest` exactly.

### Running a Paper server

Enable Paper server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=PAPER` to your command-line.

By default, the container will run the latest build of [Paper server](https://papermc.io/downloads) but you can also choose to run a specific build with `-e PAPERBUILD=205`.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=PAPER \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If you are hosting your own copy of Paper you can override the download URL with `PAPER_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>`.

If you have attached a host directory to the `/data` volume, then you can install plugins via the `plugins` subdirectory. You can also [attach a `/plugins` volume](#optional-plugins-mods-and-config-attach-points). If you add plugins while the container is running, you'll need to restart it to pick those up.

[You can also auto-download plugins using `SPIGET_RESOURCES`.](#auto-downloading-spigotmcbukkitpapermc-plugins-with-spiget)

### Running a Pufferfish server

A [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish) server, which is "a highly optimized Paper fork designed for large servers requiring both maximum performance, stability, and "enterprise" features."

    -e TYPE=PUFFERFISH

> NOTE: The `VERSION` variable is used to select branch latest, 1.18, or 1.17. Use PUFFERFISH_BUILD to really select the SERVER VERSION number.

Extra variables:
- `PUFFERFISH_BUILD=lastSuccessfulBuild` : set a specific Pufferfish build to use. Example: selecting build 47 => 1.18.1, or build 50 => 1.18.2 etc
- `FORCE_REDOWNLOAD=false` : set to true to force the located server jar to be re-downloaded
- `USE_FLARE_FLAGS=false` : set to true to add appropriate flags for the built-in [Flare](https://blog.airplane.gg/flare) profiler

### Running a Purpur server

A [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/) server, which is "a drop-in replacement for Paper servers designed for configurability and new, fun, exciting gameplay features."

    -e TYPE=PURPUR

> NOTE: the `VERSION` variable is used to lookup a build of Purpur to download

Extra variables:
- `PURPUR_BUILD=LATEST` : set a specific Purpur build to use
- `FORCE_REDOWNLOAD=false` : set to true to force the located server jar to be re-downloaded
- `USE_FLARE_FLAGS=false` : set to true to add appropriate flags for the built-in [Flare](https://blog.airplane.gg/flare) profiler
- `PURPUR_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>` : set URL to download Purpur from custom URL.

### Running a Magma server

A [Magma](https://magmafoundation.org/) server, which is a combination of Forge and PaperMC, can be used with

    -e TYPE=MAGMA

> **NOTE** there are limited base versions supported, so you will also need to  set `VERSION`, such as "1.12.2", "1.16.5", etc.


### Running a Mohist server

A [Mohist](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist) server can be used with

    -e TYPE=MOHIST

> **NOTE** there are limited base versions supported, so you will also need to  set `VERSION`, such as "1.12.2"

By default the latest build will be used; however, a specific build number can be selected by setting `MOHIST_BUILD`, such as

    -e VERSION=1.16.5 -e MOHIST_BUILD=374

### Running a Catserver type server

A [Catserver](http://catserver.moe/) type server can be used with

    -e TYPE=CATSERVER

> **NOTE** Catserver only provides a single release stream, so `VERSION` is ignored

### Running a Loliserver type server

A [Loliserver](https://github.com/Loli-Server/LoliServer) type server can be used with

    -e TYPE=LOLISERVER

> **NOTE** Loliserver only provides a single release stream, so `VERSION` is ignored

> **Disclaimer** The retrieval of the serverjar is not bulletproof. It can and probably will change in the future.

### Running a Canyon server

[Canyon](https://github.com/canyonmodded/canyon) is a fork of CraftBukkit for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3. It includes multiple enhancements whilst also retaining compatibility with old Bukkit plugins and mods as much as possible.

    -e VERSION=b1.7.3 -e TYPE=CANYON

> **NOTE** only `VERSION=b1.7.3` is supported. Since that version pre-dates the health check mechanism used by this image, that will need to be disabled by setting `DISABLE_HEALTHCHECK=true`.

By default, the latest build will be used; however, a specific build number can be selected by setting `CANYON_BUILD`, such as

    -e CANYON_BUILD=11

### Running a SpongeVanilla server

Enable SpongeVanilla server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA` to your command-line.
    
By default the container will run the latest `STABLE` version.
If you want to run a specific version, you can add `-e SPONGEVERSION=1.11.2-6.1.0-BETA-19` to your command-line.
    
Beware that current [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org) `STABLE` versions for Minecraft 1.12 require using [the Java 8 tag](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version):
    
    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server:java8-multiarch

You can also choose to use the `EXPERIMENTAL` branch.
Just change it with `SPONGEBRANCH`, such as:

    $ docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA -e SPONGEBRANCH=EXPERIMENTAL ...

### Running a Limbo server

A [Limbo](https://github.com/LOOHP/Limbo) server can be run by setting `TYPE` to `LIMBO`.

Configuration options with defaults:

- `LIMBO_BUILD`=LATEST

  The `VERSION` will be ignored so locate the appropriate value from [here](https://ci.loohpjames.com/job/Limbo/) to match the version expected by clients.

- `FORCE_REDOWNLOAD`=false
- `LIMBO_SCHEMA_FILENAME`=default.schem
- `LEVEL`="Default;${LIMBO_SCHEMA


NAME}"

> NOTE: instead of using format codes in the MOTD, Limbo requires [JSON chat content](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_JSON_text_format#Java_Edition). If a plain string is provided, which is the default, then it gets converted into the required JSON structure. 

### Running a Crucible server

A [Crucible](https://github.com/CrucibleMC/Crucible) server can be run by setting `TYPE` to `CRUCIBLE`.

Configuration options with defaults:

- `CRUCIBLE_RELEASE`=latest

Crucible is only available for 1.7.10, so be sure to set `VERSION=1.7.10`.

## Running a server with a Feed the Beast modpack

> **NOTE** requires one of the Ubuntu with Hotspot images listed in [the Java versions section](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version).

[Feed the Beast application](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/) modpacks are supported by using `-e TYPE=FTBA` (**note** the "A" at the end of the type). This server type will automatically take care of downloading and installing the modpack and appropriate version of Forge, so the `VERSION` does not need to be specified.

### Environment Variables:
- `FTB_MODPACK_ID`: **required**, the numerical ID of the modpack to install. The ID can be located by [finding the modpack](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpack) and locating the ID in this part of the URL:
  ```
  https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks/23-ftb-infinity-evolved-17
                                          ^^
  ```
- `FTB_MODPACK_VERSION_ID`: optional, the numerical ID of the version to install. If not specified, the latest version will be installed. The "Version ID" can be obtained by hovering over a server file entry and grabbing [this ID in the URL](docs/ftba-version-id-popup.png).

### Upgrading

If a specific `FTB_MODPACK_VERSION_ID` was not specified, simply restart the container to pick up the newest modpack version. If using a specific version ID, recreate the container with the new version ID.

### Example

The following example runs the latest version of [FTB Presents Direwolf20 1.12](https://ftb.neptunepowered.org/pack/ftb-presents-direwolf20-1-12/):

```
docker run -d --name mc-ftb -e EULA=TRUE \
  -e TYPE=FTBA -e FTB_MODPACK_ID=31 \
  -p 25565:25565 \
  itzg/minecraft-server:java8-multiarch
```

> Normally you will also add `-v` volume for `/data` since the mods and config are installed there along with world data.

## Running a server with a CurseForge modpack

### Auto CurseForge Management

To manage a CurseForge modpack automatically with upgrade support, pinned or latest version tracking, set `TYPE` to "AUTO_CURSEFORGE". The appropriate mod loader (Forge / Fabric) version will be automatically installed as declared by the modpack. This mode will also take care of cleaning up unused files installed by previous versions of the modpack, but world data is never auto-removed.

> **NOTES:**
> 
> A CurseForge API key is **required** to use this feature. Go to their [developer console](https://console.curseforge.com/), generate an API key, and set the environment variable `CF_API_KEY`.  
>
> When entering your API Key in a docker compose file you will need to escape any `$` character with a second `$`.  
>
> Example if your key is `$11$22$33aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`:
> ```yaml
> environment:
>   CF_API_KEY: '$$11$$22$$33aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'
> ```
> If you use `docker run` you will need to escape the `$` with a `\`.   
> Example:
> ```shell
> docker run ... -e "CF_API_KEY=\$11\$22\$33aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
> ```
> You can use a `.env` file, in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml`, and define your API Key there to remove the need to escape the `$` in your API Key. The `.env` file is [loaded automatically by docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/#substitute-with-an-env-file). 
> 
> *.env*
> ```
> CF_API_KEY=$11$22$33aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
> ```
>
> To use with `docker run` you need to specify the `.env` file
> ```
> docker run --env-file=.env itzg/minecraft-server
> ```
> 
> Be sure to use the appropriate [image tag for the Java version compatible with the modpack](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version).
> 
> Most modpacks require a good amount of memory, so it best to set `MEMORY` to at least "4G" since the default is only 1 GB.

Use one of the following to specify the modpack to install:

Pass a page URL to the modpack or a specific file with `CF_PAGE_URL` such as the modpack page "https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-8" or a specific file "https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-8/files/4248390". For example:

```
-e TYPE=AUTO_CURSEFORGE -e CF_PAGE_URL=https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-8
```

Instead of a URL, the modpack slug can be provided as `CF_SLUG`. The slug is the short identifier visible in the URL after "/modpacks/", such as

![cf-slug](docs/cf-slug.png)

For example:
```
-e TYPE=AUTO_CURSEFORGE -e CF_SLUG=all-the-mods-8
```

The latest file will be located and used by default, but if a specific version is desired you can use one of the following options. With any of these options **do not select a server file** -- they lack the required manifest and defeat the ability to consistently automate startup.

- Use `CF_PAGE_URL`, but include the full URL to a specific file
- Set `CF_FILE_ID` to the numerical file ID 
- Specify a substring to match the desired filename with `CF_FILENAME_MATCHER`

The following shows where to get the URL to the specific file and also shows where the file ID is located:

![cf-file-id](docs/cf-file-id.png)

The following examples all refer to version 1.0.7 of ATM8:

```
-e CF_PAGE_URL=https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-8/files/4248390
```

```
-e CF_SLUG=all-the-mods-8 -e CF_FILE_ID=4248390
```

```
-e CF_SLUG=all-the-mods-8 -e CF_FILENAME_MATCHER=1.0.7
```

Quite often there are mods that need to be excluded, such as ones that did not properly declare as a client mod via the file's game versions. Similarly, there are some mods that are incorrectly tagged as client only. The following describes two options to exclude/include mods:

Global and per modpack exclusions can be declared in a JSON file and referenced with `CF_EXCLUDE_INCLUDE_FILE`. By default, [the file bundled with the image](files/cf-exclude-include.json) will be used, but can be disabled by setting this to an empty string. The schema of this file [is documented here](https://github.com/itzg/mc-image-helper#excludeinclude-file-schema).

Alternatively, they can be excluded by passing a comma or space delimited list of **project** slugs or IDs via `CF_EXCLUDE_MODS`. Similarly, there are some mods that are incorrectly tagged as client only. For those, pass the **project** slugs or IDs via `CF_FORCE_INCLUDE_MODS`. These lists will be combined with the content of the exclude/include file, if given.

A mod's project ID can be obtained from the right hand side of the project page:
![cf-project-id](docs/cf-project-id.png)

If needing to iterate on the options above, set `CF_FORCE_SYNCHRONIZE` to "true" to ensure the exclude/includes are re-evaluated.

> **NOTE:** these options are provided to empower you to get your server up and running quickly. Please help out by reporting an issue with the respective mod project. Ideally mod developers should [use correct registrations for one-sided client mods](https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/latest/concepts/sides/#writing-one-sided-mods). Understandably, those code changes may be non-trivial, so mod authors can also add "Client" to the game versions when publishing.

Some modpacks come with world/save data via a worlds file and/or the overrides provided with the modpack. Either approach can be selected to set the `LEVEL` to the resulting saves directory by setting `CF_SET_LEVEL_FROM` to either:
- `WORLD_FILE`
- `OVERRIDES`

Other configuration available:
- `CF_PARALLEL_DOWNLOADS` (default is 4): specify how many parallel mod downloads to perform
- `CF_OVERRIDES_SKIP_EXISTING` (default is false): if set, files in the overrides that already exist in the data directory are skipped. **NOTE** world data is always skipped, if present.

### Old approach

Enable this server mode by adding `-e TYPE=CURSEFORGE` to your command-line,
but note the following additional steps needed...

You need to specify a modpack to run, using the `CF_SERVER_MOD` environment
variable. A CurseForge server modpack is available together with its respective
client modpack at <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks> .

Now you can add a `-e CF_SERVER_MOD=name_of_modpack.zip` to your command-line.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -e TYPE=CURSEFORGE \
        -e CF_SERVER_MOD=SkyFactory_4_Server_4.1.0.zip \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If you want to keep the pre-download modpacks separate from your data directory,
then you can attach another volume at a path of your choosing and reference that.
The following example uses `/modpacks` as the container path as the pre-download area:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -v /path/to/modpacks:/modpacks \
        -e TYPE=CURSEFORGE \
        -e CF_SERVER_MOD=/modpacks/SkyFactory_4_Server_4.1.0.zip \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

### Modpack data directory

By default, CurseForge modpacks are expanded into the sub-directory `/data/FeedTheBeast` and executed from there. (The default location was chosen for legacy reasons, when Curse and FTB were maintained together.)

The directory can be changed by setting `CF_BASE_DIR`, such as `-e CF_BASE_DIR=/data`.

### Buggy start scripts

Some modpacks have buggy or overly complex start scripts. You can avoid using the bundled start script and use this image's standard server-starting logic by adding `-e USE_MODPACK_START_SCRIPT=false`.

### Fixing "unable to launch forgemodloader"

If your server's modpack fails to load with an error [like this](https://support.feed-the-beast.com/t/cant-start-crashlanding-server-unable-to-launch-forgemodloader/6028/2):

    unable to launch forgemodloader

then you apply a workaround by adding this to the run invocation:

    -e FTB_LEGACYJAVAFIXER=true
